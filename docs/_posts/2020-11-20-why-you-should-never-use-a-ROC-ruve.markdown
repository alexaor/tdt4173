# How to blogpost
This is written in markdown. For markdown cheatsheet look at [this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
The filename has to be on the format as shown in the filename of this post, namely YEAR-MONTH-DAY-name-of-post.markdown
## Metainformation
The top section of the file includes a set of context variables which are injected into the rendered template.
The only thing which probably has to be edited are variables such as `author`, `author_bio`, `image` 
and `image2`, `date` and lastly `author_image`. All image references should point to an image asset in the
assets folder.
## Image usage
Images can be referenced like this:
`![This is image](/tdt4173/assets/images/your_image_asset_name.jpg)` which results in
![This is image](/tdt4173/assets/images/author_alex.jpg)

If you want to set the dimensions you can reference it with a HTML <img> tag like this
`<img src="/tdt4173/assets/images/your_image_asset_name.jpg" width="100px" height="100px">` giving a picture
with a height and width of 100px


<img src="/tdt4173/assets/images/author_alex.jpg" width="100px" height="100px">


## Blockquotes
Blockquotes are written with the `>` marker at the beginning of each newline in the block

### Combinations

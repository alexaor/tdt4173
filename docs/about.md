A project website for the NTNU course [TDT4173 - Machine learning](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TDT4173). The project
scope dealt with handling a small an imbalanced dataset and how to improve machine learning algorithm performance under
such circumstances.

This website is a supplementary part of the deliverable mimicking a blog-style post inspired by medium-style 
[articles](https://medium.com/). The different posts cover different aspects of the material we have covered but
in a more casual manner and with material which did not fit the narrow scope of the main project deliverable.

The project source code is available at [github](https://github.com/alexaor/tdt4173/).
